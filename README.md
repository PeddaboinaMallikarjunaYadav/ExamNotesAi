## 📌 Problem Statement

Students spend a lot of time creating structured notes from scattered resources.
This project solves that by using AI to **instantly generate organized notes, diagrams, and summaries**, saving time and improving productivity.

---

## 🔥 Key Highlight (What Makes This Project Stand Out)

* 💳 **Stripe-based Credit System**
  Users purchase credits via Stripe and use them to generate AI-powered notes.

* 🤖 **AI Notes Generation Pipeline**
  Converts raw input into structured notes + diagrams (Mermaid) + downloadable PDFs.

* 📊 **Data Visualization**
  Uses Recharts to present insights in a clean and interactive format.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User signs up / logs in
2. Purchases credits using Stripe
3. Credits are stored in MongoDB
4. User inputs topic/content
5. AI generates structured notes
6. Credits are deducted per request
7. User can view, download, or visualize notes

## 🧠 Architecture

Frontend (React) → Backend (Node.js / Express) → MongoDB

* Stripe handles secure payments
* Backend manages authentication & credit logic
* Frontend communicates with APIs and renders UI

### 📂 Explanation

* **client/**

  * Handles UI, user interactions, API integration
  * Uses React, Redux, Tailwind CSS

* **server/**

  * Handles authentication, business logic, and APIs
  * Integrates Stripe for payments
  * Connects to MongoDB
